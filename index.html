                                <p>Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat. It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. The anxiety may give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the fear is not temporary and can be overwhelming.<br><br><strong>What are anxiety disorders?&nbsp;</strong>Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.<br></p>
                                <p><strong>Types</strong><br><br><br>There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:<br><br><br><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) :</strong>&nbsp;People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.<br><br><strong>Panic Disorder :</strong>&nbsp;People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.<br><br><strong>Phobias :</strong>&nbsp;People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).<br><br><br></p>
                                <p><strong>Signs and Symptoms</strong><br><br>The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:<br><br>Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.<br><br>Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath<br><br>Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do<br><br><br><br></p>

                                <p><br>Eating disorders are serious mental health disorders. They involve severe problems with your thoughts about food and your eating behaviors. You may eat much less or much more than you need.Eating disorders are medical conditions; they are not a lifestyle choice. They affect your body's ability to get proper nutrition. This can lead to health issues, such as heart&nbsp;and kidney problems, or sometimes even death. But there are treatments that can help.<br><br></p>
                                <p><strong>Types</strong><br><br>Common types of eating disorders include:<br><br><strong>Binge-eating</strong>, which is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorder keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress. Eating too much too often can lead to weight gain and obesity. Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.<br><br><strong>Bulimia nervosa.</strong>&nbsp;People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise or fast. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight.<br><br><strong>Anorexia nervosa.</strong>&nbsp;People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously underweight. Anorexia nervosa is the least common of the three eating disorders, but it is often the most serious. It has the highest death rate of any mental disorder.<br><br></p>
                                <p><strong>Signs and Symptoms</strong><br><br>The symptoms of&nbsp;<strong>binge-eating</strong>&nbsp;include: Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour period; Eating even when you're full or not hungry;&nbsp; Eating fast during binge episodes; Eating until you're uncomfortably full; Eating alone or in secret to avoid embarrassment; Feeling distressed, ashamed, or guilty about your eating; Frequently dieting, possibly without weight loss<br><br>The symptoms of&nbsp;<strong>bulimia nervosa</strong>&nbsp;include the same symptoms as binge-eating, plus trying to get rid of the food or weight after binging by:&nbsp; Purging, making yourself throw up or using laxatives or enemas to speed up the movement of food through your body; Doing intensive and excessive exercise; Fasting<br><br>The symptoms of&nbsp;<strong>anorexia nervosa</strong>&nbsp;include:&nbsp; Eating very little, to the point of starving yourself; Intensive and excessive exercise; Extreme thinness; Intense fear of gaining weight; Distorted body image - seeing yourself as overweight even when you are severely underweight<br></p>
